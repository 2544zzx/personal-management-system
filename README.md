<h1 align="center"> Personal Management System</h1>
<p align="center"><i>Your central point for managing every personall thing that You need  <br> (if current modules allow to do that - that is).</i></p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<hr>
<p align="justify">
    I'ts easier to understand this web application when You think about CMS (Wordpress) or CRM (SugarCRM), logic behind this system is very similar to those two. My system has less possibilities than thoes above, but It just do what I want it to do. Besides writing extensions is not so hard, depending on logic behind. Anyone with proper development knowledge can pretty much write his/her own extensions for personal needs.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    As I'm working on it there will be some fixes, and new modules in future when I reach the point when I got all I need.
</p>

<h3>Reasoning/Purpose</h3>
<hr>

<p align="justify">
    I decided to create my own system, because first of all playing around with tones of plugins for wordpress and writing customizations to some existing CRMs would take me as much time as writing my own system. Besides by knowing the logic from core it's easier to write for me extensions, add additional modules, whichever i just need.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Second of all, there is no system like that, and i didn't wanted to end up integrating  docker based cloud with cms. Furthermore i just need application like that to keep organized and I'm really tired of having some very personal data on OneDrive, other on Google cloud. Some notes here,some notes there. The end goal is having an application running on terminal or raspbery 24/7 plugged into home network, without acces to internet.
</p>

<h3>Support</h3>
<hr>

<p align="justify">
    I cannot guarantee any support. I've got a job, personall things etc, I'm just sharing my code/my application as MIT. However feel totally free to ask about something, write issues etc. As mentioned I'am using and I will use this application from now on daily so there might be some changes even good for me.
</p>

<h3>Available options and modules</h3>
