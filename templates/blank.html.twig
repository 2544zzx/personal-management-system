{# Used for ajax calls - simply templates that extend from this have only desired content in body block #}

{# This must be done this way for controllers/etc - for unknown reason yaml defined globals are not working when trying to call constant() with them #}

TODO: this is source of problems for widgets - it does reloads the twig vars in js, and thats ok but when i'm in my-images
    and I will call upload module then it's messing up whild it rewrites the route with /upload
    the other way is to:
        * create template which contains all the upload page logic
        * then include that template in the main template of /upload (with this the normal ajax call works correct)
        * also include that template in new template that will be used to call the widget content specifically
        * add new function in Dialogs class for loading this template directly - without overwriting twig generated vars
